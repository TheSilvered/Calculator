     between numbers
   - changed the messages of @help, @advanced_help, @info, @bs_vshs, @bs_lang
   - now, divisions between polynomials/monomials that yield negative powers are supported
   - improved divisions between polynomials and monomials
   - improved monomial/polynomial calculation in general, less errors should occur
   - changed the extension of a calculator file from .mem to .calc, .mem files are still supported
     but to access them you have to put the filename directly on the path, when asked
   - the output in the debug mode is easier to understand
   - changed command #ltrl to _ltrl and moved into the @help_msg message

Fixes:
   - memory files can no longer be saved with an extension different from .calc
   - less unexpected errors should occur
   - now the 'X' multiplication operator in the @info message is uppercase
   - now in the @info message the second to last line says '_help _help' instead of '_help help'
   - you can no longer merge arguments with the command (es. _langen was equal to _lang en)
   - it's now possible to save files in folder with spaces in the name but the path must be surrounded by
     double quotes ("c:\users\[USERNAME]\Desktop\Random folder you probably have")
   - now the single version files from 1.0.0.0.txt to 1.0.2.1.txt will have the new arrangement
     for the changelog
   - the calculator no longer crashes if the files in the settings folder are invalid, it will overwrite
     them instead
   - it's no longer possible calculate the root of a polynomial, before the result would be wrong
   - fixed a bug that sometimes caused numbers to have a .0 ending in the literal mode
   - fixed a bug that caused the parenthesis in the output string to sometimes not be displayed correctly
   - now when the debug mode is active the output of the calculations is visible once again
   - now a blank lines appears when the @non_int_root_error message is shown
   - fixed a bug that caused two blank lined to appear when executing the command '_help _advn', now only
     one appears
   - fixed the @bs_lang message in the italian language not being consistent with the messages from other
     languages
   - now the command _vshs is listed in the @help_msg message
   - fixed a bug that didn't save the last result of an expression when the output expression was disabled
   - now a blank line appears after the number if the output expression is disabled
   - now, when pressing 'Ctrl + C' to close the calculator, it is closed correctly
   - now, in the EN.lang file, the attributes of the $msg set are properly separated by a blank line"
   - it's now possible to re-assign a value in memory without having to delete it first

Missed to declare in the last update:
   - now the calclog.log file is split in info.log, debug.log and error.log; all in the calclog folder
   - added a process_count.json file in the ~/settings directory, counts how many times the calculator has
     been opened
   - added lang files will now support special characters as long as they are encoded with the
     ANSI encoding
   - optimized calculation
