   - you can no longer save files that contain inaccessible characters
   - made the VERSION_HISTORY.txt file more accessible from versions 1.0.0.0 to the latest
   - you can no longer save a number in memory if the key it is assigned to raises a UnicodeError
     (activate #dbug mode to is when it occurs)
   - you can no longer set an operator as the name of a value stored in memory
   - now to get the help message of a command you have to put the command itself (Es. '_help #dbug')

   - now the calculator will no longer crash, instead will produce an error message describing the error

Fixes:
   - fixed a bug that caused ES.lang to not load properly
   - fixed a bug that caused the first value of an expression when the @impossible_div_error appeared
   - fixed a crash that could occur when using the '-' operator and the literal mode was enabled
   - fixed several crashes that could occur when trying to divide in the literal mode
   - fixed a bug that caused the negative numbers to be read incorrectly
   - fixed a bug that caused the 'N(' and ')N' multiplications to remove the last cipher of the number
   - fixed a crash that occurred when using the letter 'x' i a monomial/polynomial
   - fixed a bug that caused a spam when an invalid attribute had multiple lines,
     now only the first one is shown
